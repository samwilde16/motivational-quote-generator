# Quote generator

This was my first time experimenting with API's. I used [this link](https://type.fit/api/quotes) to a JSON file containing over 1600 'inspiration quotes'. From there I could pull the list and select a random quote to display to the user. 

There are improvements in the works for this project (see issues).
